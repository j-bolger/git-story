		<h2><i>Day One</i></h2><br><br>

		<p>
			I woke up on a beach. Bodies littered the sand around me. As I walked along the shore, I found a rock and a torch. Where was I?<br><br>

			I headed South and came upon a small valley dotted with stone houses. They were all locked but they seemed to be abandoned. I started to chop down trees to build a hut for myself. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a glint in some bushes behind one of the houses. It was a pickaxe! There was also some food and clothes in a small wooden chest in the bush.<br><br>

			I made a small shelter for myself and then left in search of somewhere to mine out some stone for my house. I had noticed that scattered around this island where many Large lumps of rock. I started to swing at one and collected the chunks that came away. After a few hours of mining I was ready to return home. I had collected more than enough stone to fortify my shelter against the weather (and any would-be attackers - if there even is anybody else still alive in this god-forsaken place).<br><br>

			When I was mining, I found metal ores in some of the rock nodes. I remembered seeing some furnaces on the other side of the valley, so I went to see if I could smelt the ores. Whilst my ores cooked, I ventured further into the forest beside me. As I got further in, a wild boar darted out in front of my. I picked up the chase and found myself staring at a huge wall. It stretched about a kilometre in each direction. A few metres up I saw that the wall had caved in. I climbed over the rubble, and found myself standing on an old military airfield!<br><br>

			Looking around, I saw wrecked cars, barrels, crates, and big boxes. I went over to the nearest crate and pried it open. Inside it was a pistol and some ammunition! I went into one of the hangars. There was a whole load of metal sheets inside. I thought I might be able to use them to help fortify my house. I wrapped some in some tarp I found nearby, and dragged it over to the hole in the wall. I decided that I would finish transporting it to my house the next day, so I suspended the sheets from a tree to keep them safe.<br><br>

			I went to return to the furnaces and see if I had successfully smelted any metal from the ores when I heard something behind me. I spun around, gun drawn, only to see that it was the boar from earlier. I contemplated killing it for food, but I already had plenty at home. I turned back pn my way once again, only to become face to face with a wolf. It growled at me ferociously. I went for my gun but it was too late. The wolf leapt up and tackled me to the ground. I screamed as it tore at my arms, raised in a feeble attempt to push the wolf off me. It tore at my throat, and I began to feel faint as I choked on my own blood. The light began to fade...
