		<h3>A story of survival</h3>

		<p>
			<br><h2><i>Day One</i></h2><br>

			I woke up on a beach. Bodies littered the sand around me. As I walked along the shore, I found a rock and a torch. Where was I?<br><br>

			I could see small huts in the distance, and a massive compound to the North. I went to investigate, and to see if there were any other survivors like myself. The compound seemed to be some kind of power plant. I decided that I woul dneed to be more prepared if I were to attempt to enter the place.<br><br>

			I needed a place to stay. All of the huts I encountered seemed to have locks on their doors. I used my rock to chop up a tree and got to work building.<br><br>

			"Hey man, are you friendly?"<br><br>

			I Jumped up, startled to hear another voice on this desolate island.<br><br>

			"Yeah. The names Mike. You stuck here too?" I asked.<br><br>

			"Sure am. I'm Richard, but you can call me Rick" he said. "Hey, I found this huge building over that hill. I think the owners might have some loot. Want to help me get in?"<br><br>

			Huge building? Loot? Where the hell am I? Why would people stay here if they might have a chance of getting off? "Sure, I guess" I replied.<br><br>

			And so we made our way over to this "base" that Rick found, until...<br><br>

			"BEAR!"<br><br>

			We froze. It hadn't seen us yet. We crept over to a hut beside us. It began to walk off in the other direction.<br><br>

			"That's the base there" Rick whispered. "We can sprint over and hide in the gateway."<br><br>

			We got to the base and managed to shake the bear in the process.<br><br>

			"Here, boost me up over this wall" said Rick. He dropped down on the other side. "Ok, I'm goo-"<br><br>

			There was a sharp ratatat on the other side of the wall.<br><br>

			"Damn turrets!" Rick cursed. "I'm gonna have to find another way in."<br><br>

			As he said this, I heard doors open and close inside the base.<br><br>

			"Someone's coming!" I ran over to a large furnace outside the gate. I climbed up, and managed to jump onto a little roof just outside the door. It opened, and two men, armed with what looked like shot guns crafted from salvaged materials, and armour fashioned from road signs walked out.<br><br>

			"I heard them out here" said one of them. They began to search the courtyard, and then went around the perimeter. They returned about 10 minutes later and went inside.<br><br>

			"Probably some nakeds" they sneered. They went back inside, so I went to jump down and check on Rick. Before I knew what was happening, one of the men burst back out of door, shotgun pointed at me. Before I could even say anything...<br><br>

			<strong>BANG! BANG!</strong>
