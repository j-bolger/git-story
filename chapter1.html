			I don't know what to do for this so I'll just write out what's in my head at the time.<br>

			As you've probably noticed, I have a terrible habit of leaving things 'til the last second. I just got finished starting on a project thats due in two days, so that will be late. I've only started doing this properly now, so <strong>this</strong> is late.
			I'll undountedly be late to your lecture on Tuesday (although I hope you take my question sheet this time!).<br>
